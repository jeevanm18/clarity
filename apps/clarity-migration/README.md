# Clarity Migration

This project is a sample of before and after components when comparing @clr/angular to @clr/core implementations. This is meant to guide developers who wish to migrate between packages and to understand what the differences are.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
